This is a fork of the official F2 mission-making framework which can be found here (including documentation):
http://www.ferstaberinde.com/f2/en/

It uses all features mentioned on the wiki EXCLUDING:
- norrin's revive 0.3


USAGE
=====

0. Copy the folder f2_v2-6-2_i44 into Documents/Arma 2 Other Profiles/*Your Name*/MPMissions

1. In the editor create and save a new mission on the map of your choosing.

2. Merge the mission with the Mission stub or simply copy over the units you want to use.

3. Copy all contents from the mission stub folder into the folder of your new missions, 
overwriting everything apart from mission.sqm (which should be the only prompt)

4. Consult the F2 Wiki for any further questions
(e.g. modifying the briefing): http://www.ferstaberinde.com/f2/en/
